    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In an [earlier lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/need_for_speed.html) we learned about vectorization, which is one method to improve speed and efficiency in numerical work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectorization involves sending array processing\n",
    "operations in batch to efficient low-level code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as [discussed previously](https://python.quantecon.org/need_for_speed.html#numba-p-c-vectorization), vectorization has several weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "One is that it is highly memory-intensive when working with large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another is that the set of algorithms that can be entirely vectorized is not universal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, for some algorithms, vectorization is ineffective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, a new Python library called [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/)\n",
    "solves many of these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does so through something called **just in time (JIT) compilation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to compile functions to native machine code instructions on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it succeeds, the compiled code is extremely fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba is specifically designed for numerical work and can also do other tricks such as [multithreading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multithreading_%28computer_architecture%29).\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba will be a key part of our lectures — especially those lectures involving dynamic programming.\n",

    "### How and When it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba attempts to generate fast machine code using the infrastructure provided by the [LLVM Project](http://llvm.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by inferring type information on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "(See our [earlier lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/need_for_speed.html) on scientific computing for a discussion of types.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is very flexible and hence we could call the function qm with many\n",
    "  types.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  - e.g., `x0` could be a NumPy array or a list, `n` could be an integer or a float, etc.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- This makes it hard to *pre*-compile the function.  \n",
    "- However, when we do actually call the function, say by executing `qm(0.5, 10)`,\n",
    "  the types of `x0` and `n` become clear.  \n",
    "- Moreover, the types of other variables in `qm` can be inferred once the input is known.  \n",
    "- So the strategy of Numba and other JIT compilers is to wait until this\n",
    "  moment, and *then* compile the function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why it is called “just-in-time” compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, if you make the call `qm(0.5, 10)` and then follow it with `qm(0.9, 20)`, compilation only takes place on the first call.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We generally prefer to force an error when this occurs, so we know effective\n",
