    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In our lecture on [NumPy](https://lectures.quantecon.org/numpy.html), we learned one method to improve speed and efficiency in numerical work.\n",
    "\n",
    "That method, called *vectorization*, involved sending array processing operations in batch to efficient low-level code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This clever idea dates back to Matlab, which uses it extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, vectorization is limited and has several weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "One weakness is that it is highly memory-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is that only some algorithms can be vectorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last few years, a new Python library called [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) has appeared that\n",
    "solves many of these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does so through something called **just in time (JIT) compilation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "JIT compilation is effective in many numerical settings and can generate extremely fast, efficient code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also do other tricks such as facilitate multithreading (a form of parallelization well suited to numerical work)."

    "### The Need for Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand what Numba does and why, we need some background knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start by thinking about higher-level languages, such as Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "These languages are optimized for humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the programmer can leave many details to the runtime environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- specifying variable types  \n",
    "- memory allocation/deallocation, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The upside is that, compared to low-level languages, Python is typically faster to write, less error-prone and  easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside is that Python is harder to optimize — that is, turn into fast machine code — than languages like C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the standard implementation of Python (called CPython) cannot match the speed of compiled languages such as C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that mean that we should just switch to C or Fortran for everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is no, no and one hundred times no.\n",
    "\n",
    "High productivity languages should be chosen over high-speed languages for the great majority of scientific computing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Of any given program, relatively few lines are ever going to be time-critical.  \n",
    "1. For those lines of code that *are* time-critical, we can achieve C-like speed using a combination of NumPy and Numba.  \n",

    "### How and When it Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba attempts to generate fast machine code using the infrastructure provided by the [LLVM Project](http://llvm.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by inferring type information on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, this is easier for simple Python objects (simple scalar data types, such as floats, integers, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Numba also plays well with NumPy arrays, which it treats as typed memory regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal setting, Numba can infer all necessary type information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows it to generate native machine code, without having to call the Python runtime environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In such a setting, Numba will be on par with machine code from low-level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Numba cannot infer all type information, some Python objects are given generic `object` status, and some code is generated using the Python runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this second setting, Numba typically provides only minor speed gains — or none at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, it’s prudent when using Numba to focus on speeding up small, time-critical snippets of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give you much better performance than blanketing your Python programs with `@jit` statements."
