    "\n",

    "Statistical Research Group at Columbia University.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s listen to Milton Friedman tell us what happened\n",
    "\n",
    "> In order to understand the story, it is necessary to have an idea of a\n",
    "simple statistical problem, and of the standard procedure for dealing\n",
    "with it. The actual problem out of which sequential analysis grew will\n",
    "serve. The Navy has two alternative designs (say A and B) for a\n",
    "projectile. It wants to determine which is superior. To do so it\n",
    "undertakes a series of paired firings. On each round, it assigns the\n",
    "value 1 or 0 to A accordingly as its performance is superior or inferior\n",
    "to that of B and conversely 0 or 1 to B. The Navy asks the statistician\n",
    "how to conduct the test and how to analyze the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> The standard statistical answer was to specify a number of firings (say\n",
    "1,000) and a pair of percentages (e.g., 53% and 47%) and tell the client\n",
    "that if A receives a 1 in more than 53% of the firings, it can be\n",
    "regarded as superior; if it receives a 1 in fewer than 47%, B can be\n",
    "regarded as superior; if the percentage is between 47% and 53%, neither\n",
    "can be so regarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> When Allen Wallis was discussing such a problem with (Navy) Captain\n",
    "Garret L. Schyler, the captain objected that such a test, to quote from\n",
    "Allen’s account, may prove wasteful. If a wise and seasoned ordnance\n",
    "officer like Schyler were on the premises, he would see after the first\n",
    "few thousand or even few hundred [rounds] that the experiment need not\n",
    "be completed either because the new method is obviously inferior or\n",
    "because it is obviously superior beyond what was hoped for\n",

    "> A test procedure leading to the acceptance or rejection of the [null]\n",
    "hypothesis in question is simply a rule specifying, for each possible\n",
    "sample of size $ n $, whether the [null] hypothesis should be accepted\n",
    "or rejected on the basis of the sample. This may also be expressed as\n",
    "follows: A test procedure is simply a subdivision of the totality of\n",
    "all possible samples of size $ n $ into two mutually exclusive\n",
    "parts, say part 1 and part 2, together with the application of the\n",
    "rule that the [null] hypothesis be accepted if the observed sample is\n",

    "or rejecting $ H_0 $ we may commit errors of two kinds. We commit\n",
    "an error of the first kind if we reject $ H_0 $ when it is true;\n",
    "we commit an error of the second kind if we accept $ H_0 $ when\n",

    "\n",
    "Let’s listen carefully to how Wald applies law of large numbers to\n",

    "> The probabilities $ \\alpha $ and $ \\beta $ have the\n",
    "following important practical interpretation: Suppose that we draw a\n",

    "number of such samples drawn. Suppose that for each of these\n",
    "$ M $ samples we reject $ H_0 $ if the sample is included in\n",
    "$ W $ and accept $ H_0 $ if the sample lies outside\n",
    "$ W $. In this way we make $ M $ statements of rejection or\n",
    "acceptance. Some of these statements will in general be wrong. If\n",
    "$ H_0 $ is true and if $ M $ is large, the probability is\n",
    "nearly $ 1 $ (i.e., it is practically certain) that the\n",
    "proportion of wrong statements (i.e., the number of wrong statements\n",
    "divided by $ M $) will be approximately $ \\alpha $. If\n",
    "$ H_1 $ is true, the probability is nearly $ 1 $ that the\n",
    "proportion of wrong statements will be approximately $ \\beta $.\n",
    "Thus, we can say that in the long run [ here Wald applies law of\n",
    "large numbers by driving $ M \\rightarrow \\infty $ (our comment,\n",

    "the first two observations, one of the three decision is made. If the\n",
    "third decision is made, a third trial is performed, and so on. The\n",
