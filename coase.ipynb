    "In 1937, Ronald Coase wrote a brilliant essay on the nature of the firm [[Coa37]](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#coase1937nature).\n",
    "\n",
    "Coase was writing at a time when the Soviet Union was rising to become a significant industrial power.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, many free-market economies were afflicted by a severe and painful depression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This contrast led to an intensive debate on the relative\n",
    "merits of decentralized, price-based allocation versus top-down planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the midst of this debate, Coase made an important observation:\n",
    "even in free-market economies, a great deal of top-down planning does in fact take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because *firms* form an integral part of free-market economies and, within firms, allocation is by planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, free-market economies blend both planning (within firms) and decentralized production coordinated by prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question Coase asked is this: if prices and free markets are so efficient, then why do firms even exist?\n",
    "\n",

    "### Why Firms Exist\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of asking a deep and fascinating question, Coase also supplied an illuminating answer: firms exist because of transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s one example of a transaction cost:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose agent A is considering setting up a small business and needs a web developer to construct and help run an online store.\n",
    "\n",
    "She can use the labor of agent B, a web developer, by writing up a freelance contract for these tasks and agreeing on a suitable price.\n",
    "\n",
    "But contracts like this can be time-consuming and difficult to verify\n",
    "\n",
    "- How will agent A be able to specify exactly what she wants, to the finest detail, when she herself isn’t sure how the business will evolve?  \n",
    "- And what if she isn’t familiar with web technology?  How can she specify all the relevant details?  \n",
    "- And, if things go badly, will failure to comply with the contract be verifiable in court?  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this situation, perhaps it will be easier to *employ* agent B under a simple labor contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of this contract is far smaller because such contracts are simpler and more standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic agreement in a labor contract is: B will do what A asks him to do for the term of the contract, in return for a given salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making this agreement is much easier than trying to map every task out in advance in a contract that will hold up in a court of law.\n",
    "\n",
    "So agent A decides to hire agent B and a firm of nontrivial size appears, due to transaction costs."

    "### A Trade-Off\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, we haven’t yet come to the heart of Coase’s investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue of why firms exist is a binary question: should firms have positive size or zero size?\n",
    "\n",
    "A better and more general question is: **what determines the size of firms**?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer Coase came up with was that “a firm will tend to expand until the costs of organizing an extra\n",
    "transaction within the firm become equal to the costs of carrying out the same\n",
    "transaction by means of an exchange on the open market…” ([[Coa37]](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#coase1937nature), p. 395).\n",

    "But what are these internal and external costs?\n",

    "- diminishing returns to management, which adds to the expense of operating *within* firms  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed an example of transaction costs above (contracts).\n",
    "\n",
    "The other cost, diminishing returns to management, is a catch-all for the idea\n",
    "that big operations are increasingly costly to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you could think of management as a pyramid, so hiring more workers to implement more tasks\n",
    "requires expansion of the pyramid, and hence labor costs grow at a rate more than\n",
    "proportional to the range of tasks.\n",
