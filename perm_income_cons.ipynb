    "As we saw in our [previous lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/perm_income.html) on this topic, Robert Hall [[Hal78]](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#hall1978) used the LQ permanent income model to restrict and interpret intertemporal comovements of nondurable consumption, nonfinancial income, and financial wealth.\n",

    "\n",
    "- consumption is a random walk  \n",
    "- financial wealth has a unit root and is cointegrated with consumption  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Other applications use the same LQ framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a model isomorphic to the LQ permanent income model has been used by Robert Barro [[Bar79]](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#barro1979) to interpret intertemporal comovements of a government’s tax collections, its  expenditures net of debt service, and its public debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "This isomorphism means that in analyzing the LQ permanent income model, we are in effect also analyzing  the Barro tax smoothing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is just a matter of appropriately relabeling the variables in Hall’s model.\n",

    "In this lecture, we’ll\n",
