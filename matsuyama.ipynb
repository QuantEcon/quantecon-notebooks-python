    "In this lecture, we review the paper [Globalization and Synchronization of Innovation Cycles](http://www.centreformacroeconomics.ac.uk/Discussion-Papers/2015/CFMDP2015-27-Paper.pdf) by [Kiminori Matsuyama](http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~kmatsu/), [Laura Gardini](http://www.mdef.it/index.php?id=32) and [Iryna Sushko](http://irynasushko.altervista.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This model helps us understand several interesting stylized facts about the world economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these is synchronized business cycles across different countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most existing models that generate synchronized business cycles do so by assumption, since they tie output in each country to a common shock.\n",
    "\n",
    "They also fail to explain certain features of the data, such as the fact that the degree of synchronization tends to increase with trade ties.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, in the model we consider in this lecture, synchronization is both endogenous and increasing with the extent of trade integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, as trade costs fall and international competition increases, innovation incentives become aligned and countries synchronize their innovation cycles."

    "On the technical side, the paper introduces the concept of [coupled oscillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscillation#Coupled_oscillations) to economic modeling.\n",

    "### Innovation Cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed above, two countries produce and trade with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each country, firms innovate, producing new varieties of goods and, in doing so, receiving temporary monopoly power.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imitators follow and, after one period of monopoly, what had previously been new varieties now enter competitive production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firms have incentives to innovate and produce new goods when the mass of varieties of goods currently in production is relatively low.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there are strategic complementarities in the timing of innovation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firms have incentives to innovate in the same period, so as to avoid competing with substitutes that are competitively produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to temporal clustering in innovations in each country.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a burst of innovation, the mass of goods currently in production increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, goods also become obsolete, so that not all survive from period to period.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism generates a cycle, where the mass of varieties increases through simultaneous innovation and then falls through obsolescence."
