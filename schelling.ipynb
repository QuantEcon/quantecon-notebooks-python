    "In 1969, Thomas C. Schelling developed a simple but striking model of racial segregation [[Sch69]](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#schelling1969).\n",
    "\n",
    "His model studies the dynamics of racially mixed neighborhoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like much of Schelling’s work, the model shows how local interactions can lead to surprising aggregate structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, it shows that relatively mild preference for neighbors of similar race can lead in aggregate to the collapse of mixed neighborhoods, and high levels of segregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In recognition of this and other research, Schelling was awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (joint with Robert Aumann).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The algorithm for moving is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Draw a random location in $ S $  \n",
    "1. If happy at new location, move there  \n",
    "1. Else, go to step 1  \n",
