    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we study a simplified version of an uncertainty traps model of Fajgelbaum, Schaal and Taschereau-Dumouchel [[FSTD15]](https://python.quantecon.org/zreferences.html#fun).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model features self-reinforcing uncertainty that has big impacts on economic activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fundamentals  vary stochastically and are not fully observable.  \n",
    "- At any moment there are both active and inactive entrepreneurs; only active entrepreneurs produce.  \n",
    "- Agents – active and inactive entrepreneurs –  have beliefs about the fundamentals expressed as probability distributions.  \n",
    "- Greater uncertainty means greater dispersions of these distributions.  \n",
    "- Entrepreneurs are risk-averse and hence less inclined to be active  when uncertainty is high.  \n",
    "- The output of active entrepreneurs is observable, supplying a noisy signal that helps everyone inside the model infer fundamentals.  \n",
    "- Entrepreneurs update their beliefs about fundamentals using Bayes’ Law, implemented via [Kalman filtering](https://python.quantecon.org/kalman.html).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty traps emerge because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High uncertainty discourages entrepreneurs from becoming active.  \n",
    "- A low level of participation – i.e., a smaller number of active entrepreneurs – diminishes the flow of information about fundamentals.  \n",
    "- Less information translates to higher uncertainty, further discouraging entrepreneurs from choosing to be active, and so on.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty traps stem from a positive externality: high aggregate economic activity levels generates valuable information.\n",
