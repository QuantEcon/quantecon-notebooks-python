    "### Fitted Value Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='index-7'></a>\n",
    "The first step is to compute the value function by value function iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, the algorithm is as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Begin with a function $ v $ — an initial condition.  \n",
    "1. Solving [(11)](#equation-fcbell20-optgrowth), obtain the function $ Tv $.  \n",
    "1. Unless some stopping condition is satisfied, set $ v = Tv $ and go to step 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This generates the sequence $ v, Tv, T^2v, \\ldots $.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a problem we must confront before we implement this procedure:\n",
    "The iterates can neither be calculated exactly nor stored on a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see the issue, consider [(11)](#equation-fcbell20-optgrowth).\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if $ v $ is a known function, unless $ Tv $ can be shown to have\n",
    "some special structure, the only way to store it is to record the\n",
    "value $ Tv(y) $ for every $ y \\in \\mathbb R_+ $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clearly, this is impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we will do instead is use **fitted value function iteration**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure is to record the value of the function $ Tv $ at only\n",
    "finitely many “grid” points $ y_1 < y_2 < \\cdots < y_I $ and reconstruct it from this information when required.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, the algorithm will be\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='fvi-alg'></a>\n",
    "1. Begin with an array of values $ \\{ v_1, \\ldots, v_I \\} $ representing\n",
    "  the values of some initial function $ v $ on the grid points $ \\{ y_1, \\ldots, y_I \\} $.  \n",
    "1. Build a function $ \\hat v $ on the state space $ \\mathbb R_+ $ by\n",
    "  interpolation or approximation, based on these data points.  \n",
    "1. Obtain and record the value $ T \\hat v(y_i) $ on each grid point\n",
    "  $ y_i $ by repeatedly solving [(11)](#equation-fcbell20-optgrowth).  \n",
    "1. Unless some stopping condition is satisfied, set\n",
    "  $ \\{ v_1, \\ldots, v_I \\} = \\{ T \\hat v(y_1), \\ldots, T \\hat v(y_I) \\} $ and go to step 2.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How should we go about step 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a problem of function approximation, and there are many ways to approach it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s important here is that the function approximation scheme must not only\n",
    "produce a good approximation to $ Tv $, but also combine well with the broader iteration algorithm described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "One good choice from both respects is continuous piecewise linear interpolation (see <a href=_static/lecture_specific/optgrowth/3ndp.pdf download>this paper</a> for further discussion).\n",
