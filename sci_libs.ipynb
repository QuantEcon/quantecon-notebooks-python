    "Like [Numba](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/numba.html),  [Cython](http://cython.org/) provides an approach to generating fast compiled code that can be used from Python\n",
    "\n",
    "As was the case with Numba, a key problem is the fact that Python is dynamically typed\n",
    "\n",
    "As you’ll recall, Numba solves this problem (where possible) by inferring type\n",

    "As such, the Cython language can be thought of as Python with type definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to a language specification, Cython is also a language translator, transforming Cython code into optimized C and C++ code\n",
    "\n",
    "Cython also takes care of building language extensions — the wrapper code that interfaces between the resulting compiled code and Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:**\n",

    "In what follows code is executed in a Jupyter notebook\n",
