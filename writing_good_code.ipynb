    "When computer programs are small, poorly written code is not overly costly.\n",

    "But more data, more sophisticated models, and more computer power are enabling us to take on more challenging problems that involve writing longer programs.\n",

    "For such programs, investment in good coding practices will pay high returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main payoffs are higher productivity and faster code.\n",

    "In this lecture, we review some elements of good coding practice.\n",

    "If you look at the code above, you’ll see numbers like 50 and 49 and 3 scattered through the code.\n",

    "These kinds of numeric literals in the body of your code are sometimes called “magic numbers”.\n",

    "\n",
