    "For example, it’s almost always better to use an existing routine for root\n",

    "\n",
    "Indeed, the standard implementation of Python (called CPython) cannot match the speed of compiled languages such as C or Fortran.\n",
    "\n",
    "Does that mean that we should just switch to C or Fortran for everything?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: No, no and one hundred times no!\n",
    "\n",
    "(This is what you should say to the senior professor insisting that the model\n",
    "needs to be rewritten in Fortran or C++.)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two reasons why:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, for any given program, relatively few lines are ever going to\n",
    "be time-critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence it is far more efficient to write most of our code in a high productivity language like Python.\n",

    "## Beyond Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "At its best, vectorization yields fast, simple code.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it’s not without disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "One issue is that it can be highly memory-intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the vectorized maximization routine above is far more memory\n",
    "intensive than the non-vectorized version that preceded it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because vectorization tends to create many intermediate arrays before\n",
    "producing the final calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is that not all algorithms can be vectorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these kinds of settings, we need to go back to loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, there are alternative ways to speed up Python loops that work in\n",
    "almost any setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the last few years, a new Python library called [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) has appeared that solves the main problems\n",
    "with vectorization listed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "It does so through something called **just in time (JIT) compilation**,\n",
    "which can generate extremely fast and efficient code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll learn how to use Numba [soon](https://python.quantecon.org/numba.html)."
