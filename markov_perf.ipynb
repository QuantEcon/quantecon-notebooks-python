    "Markov perfect equilibrium is a refinement of the concept of Nash equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used to study settings where multiple decision-makers interact non-cooperatively over time, each pursuing its own objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agents in the model face a common state vector, the time path of which is influenced by – and influences – their decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, the transition law for the state that confronts each agent is affected by decision rules of other agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual payoff maximization requires that each agent solve a dynamic programming problem that includes  this transition law.\n",
